# Hi there, n1j0 here 👋

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I write code, break things, and sometimes even fix them.

> I'm on a mission to make the web a safer place 🛡️
> – one line of code at a time

## What I (try to) do 🎯

* 🤖 Write code that properly can train AI models (so that I no longer have to read "Right, I did a mistake" AND the exact same code is generated – again)
* 💼 Work on stuff I can't explain when family and friends ask me what I do at work
* 🌱 Learn how to create a privacy-focused and more secure web
* ⚙️ Automate security vulnerability detection and patching

## Fun facts ✨

* 🐛 I can debug other people's code faster than my own
* 🍍 I believe in "secure by design" – just like I believe in pizza *with* pineapple
* 📚 I probably read more scientific papers, laws, GDPR guidelines, RFCs and GitHub Advisories than fiction… and I’m not even mad about it

## Thanks for checking in 💖
